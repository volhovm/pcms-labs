dm-labs
-------

Discrete math labs written in java\scala (II semester), needed libraries, sources to labs. 
To use it make sure your java home directory is set to data_sources. Most of
it passes through pcms tests (if not, it's usually mentioned) but use it at your own risk.

 **Please respect me and don't use solutions until current lab is over, or change code properly (shuffle functions, rename variables, change methods signatures etc.)**
